1.0.0 - Feb 21, 2016
-- sqlite now uses rowids to avoid "achilles heel" problem
-- fixed bug where people using callbacks would not be informed of errors
-- populating from existing data now allows specifying column_name
-- bumped to 1.0.0 due to deciding this module is feature complete and stable

0.13.0 - Feb 9, 2016
-- Upgraded all dependent modules

0.12.0 - Jan 30, 2016
-- Added ability to resolve foreign keys from existing data

0.11.0 - June 14th, 2015
-- Added ability to pass an existing knex instance into sql-fixtures

0.10.2 - June 14th, 2015
-- fix for issue #31 where tables with date columns were not being retrieved
properly in insertRecordsSerially()

0.10.1 - April 26, 2015
-- more accurate detection of postgres. Some postgres users were falsely
detected, causing them to go into serial mode when it wasn't needed

0.10.0 - April 26, 2015
-- Since everything got confusing with 0.9.0 and 0.9.3, just bumping a new
release to get past the confusion.

0.9.0 - March 29, 2015
-- added showWarning option to allow suppressing the no primary key warning.

0.8.3 - Feb 3, 2015
-- Fix for isPostgres(). It wasn't accounting for connection strings versus objects.

0.8.2 - Jan 31, 2015
-- hopefully more robust fix for the MySQL bug 0.8.1 tried to address (#22)

0.8.1 - Jan 29, 2015
-- added "order by id" for retrieving inserted records for mysql, fixes issue #22

0.8.0 - Jan 7, 2015
-- added documentation website

0.7.0 - Dec 26, 2014
-- added integration tests for MariaDB

0.6.0 - Dec 10, 2014
-- added experimental support for "unique" (see README)

0.5.0 - Dec 1, 2014
-- added support for Postgres array columns

0.4.2 - Dec 1, 2014
-- Postgres now inserts in bulk again for a nice speed up. MySQL and Sqlite also insert in bulk now, but they must then serially query the database to retrieve what was inserted.
-- clean up: integration tests are cleaner, and use more generic/test appropriate database tables

0.4.1 - Oct 31, 2014
-- Before MySQL and sqlite worked (< 0.3.0), inserts were done in bulk, and that meant primary keys ascended in a predictable manner.
   From 0.3.0 on, inserts were done one at a time and in parallel, removing the predictable id ordering. 0.4.1 changes it to
   insert records serially to bring back that predictable ordering at the cost of sql-fixtures being slightly slower.

0.4.0 - Oct 30, 2014
-- Added integration tests for MySQL

0.3.1 - Oct 27, 2014
-- Tiny branch depending on db dialect, keeps postgres rock solid and does the best it can with other dbs
   (basically postgres will return what got inserted, mysql/sqlite/etc do not, so have to make a slight guess with those dbs)

0.3.0 - Oct 27, 2014
-- Added integration tests for sqlite, feeling pretty good about sqlite support

0.2.2 - Oct 23, 2014
-- bug fix: allowing more than one instance of sqlFixtures to get generated

0.2.1 - Oct 22, 2014
-- bug fix: only cloning what is being mutated, so knex raw objects don't get wiped out

0.2.0 - Oct 21, 2014
-- the only columns returned in the result are those that are specified

0.1.10 - Oct 20, 2014
-- Added alias for disconnect over to destroy, to maintain backwards compatibility
   0.1.9 lacked disconnect, it got renamed to destroy.

0.1.9 - Oct 20, 2014
-- sql-fixtures can now be instantiated if need be, and also used same as before (see README for more info)

0.1.8 - Oct 16, 2014
-- The inserts into the database now return all columns, enabling many-to-many and auto-populated columns to work

0.1.7 - Oct 16, 2014
-- Fixed some minor bugs that creeped in during 0.1.6

0.1.6 - Oct 16, 2014
-- fixed issue #5, where complex dependencies could result in records changing position in the final result

0.1.5 - Oct 11, 2014
-- Cleaned up the npm package, removing all tests and vagrant stuff

0.1.4 - Oct 10, 2014
